# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you need to discuss the change you wish to make feel free to open an issue. We're also on [Gitter]().

## Pull Request
**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)
### Workflow
We only work with the `master` branch for deployments and with feature branches (ex : `feature/my-feature`) for new features. You can also create a fix branch (ex : `fix/my-fix`) when you want to make a patch.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new feature / fix branch from the latest version of master
2. Start coding
3. Open a pull request, a core developer will review your contribution and merge it

Thank you!
